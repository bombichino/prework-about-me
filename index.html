      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an actor and musician in NYC finding my way into a parallel life as a web developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from Southern Vermont.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Photography, puppy watching, and bacon.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I already have one, so it's time for antoher! Acting and writing take up much of my time, but I'm adding to my plate and putting development on that list. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Brooklyn, NY</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As an actor, it's beneficial to have a parallel career and life, and web development (custom websites and applications) has always piqued my interest. It's something creative that I can do along side and in-between my theatre and film work. Having a day job (or parallel career) that you love is so important!</p>
